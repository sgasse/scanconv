# Scan Converter

In this repository, I develop a small program to solve an everyday task of mine - to crop and transform a sheet of paper from a photo. The subtasks are:
 - find the corners of the sheet of paper in the image
 - transform the image with its perspective
 - downscale the image
 - save as small jpg
 - convert all images in one folder to a pdf
